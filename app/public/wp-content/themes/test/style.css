Description: Bornholm is great for your photoblog or portfolio website. The theme comes with two page templates. One template shows the last galleries from your categories and the other shows all your galleries on one page. Furthermore, it brings two widgets that allow you to display the last galleries and to display featured galleries. If you already have images on your blog, you should regenerate the thumbnails.
